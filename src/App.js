// When the URL changes the 'Redirect' component go through all the routes
// and see if the path is '/', render that. If the path is anything else,

// The 'Switch' component instructs react router that inside of the switch block
// whenever it encounters a fitting root, it will not evaluate the lines thereafter,
// so it will not redirect if it was able to identify the path.
